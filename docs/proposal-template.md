# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

* We are creating a journaling app that is centralized around a person's mindfulness and self-motivation. The project is going to be a journaling app that integrates the users media such as pictures and video. Users can upload media from throughout their day and write about their experiences. For the user's journal entries, they can come up with ideas on their owns, or can be suggested journal prompts by the app. 

	
* The journals can be uploaded to the public by the user's public or private profile if they choose to do so. Users can share these blogs onto social media accounts such as Facebook, twitter/x, instagram. There will be a homepage where people can see other user's public journal entries and can comment on the entries. There will be no likes/dislikes in order to promote real connections. We will have a profile screen and a screen that is organized through a photo album that happens to be sorted by a calendar which you can access by the specific date. 

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)

We will need to have an iphone, canva, native ios, firebase, and swift. 

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

First, we will create our requirements, and we will choose who will do each requirement. Next, we will create what the UI using figma or canva. We will work on the backend first, then we will integrate it with the mobile side. Throughout the process, we will create tests to ensure that things are working as anticipated and meeting the requirements.  

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

Our first milestone will be getting our requirements by the allocated due date. The requirements will ideally take one week. The UI milestone will take about 1-2 weeks to finish. The Backend/firebase setup will take the most time at around 2-3 weeks. We will integrate it with the frontend which will take about 3 weeks.

# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)

We will have to get everyone on board with IOS development. We will have to figure out how to get everyone used with their assigned roles with the project. We will also have to learn how to use figma. We still have to think about how to implement the prompt feature of the app.
