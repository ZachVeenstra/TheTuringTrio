# Change Management Plan
This change management plan will help enable our users to run, use, 
test, and submit feedback about our app.  

## How will we train people to use the app?
We will send an email invitation to our TestFlight project. The content 
of the email will contain a link to download the app via TestFlight, and 
instructions of how to test the app. Included in the instructions will 
be the following description:  
Congratulations! You have been selected as a beta-tester for the Smart 
Journal app. This email contains a link to download our app via TestFlight, 
which will allow you to run it on your own device. Once the app is downloaded, 
please create an account using your email. From there, test out any 
features that interest you! You can fill out your profile info, an create 
journal entries for anyone else to see. If you have any feedback, take 
a screenshot and let us know what went wrong, or if you have any suggestions! 
Thank you for being a valued tester.

## How will we ensure it integrates within their ecosystem/software?
Our app will be available on TestFlight. TestFlight is a platform that 
allows developers to host their app before it is formally released to the app 
store. It also automatically ensures that the user is able to run/use the app 
on their device. 

## How will we ensure that any discovered issues are resolved?
TestFlight has a feature that allows users to submit feedback directly 
from our beta app. This can be done by taking a screenshot in the app, 
which will invite them to submit detailed feedback about any potential 
bugs they encountered. TestFlight also automatically sends crash reports. 
With the combination of bug and crash reports, our team will be able to
closely monitor any issues, and address them as they come up.
